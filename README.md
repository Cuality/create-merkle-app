# Create Merkle App

By [Backseats](https://twitter.com/backseats_eth)

* This is an example app that shows you how to use a Merkle tree for your allow list
* Includes a partial contract `contracts/MerkleExample.sol` with sample code
* Includes `merkle_test_script.js` which you can run to test addresses that are in and outside of an array of addresses (ie your allow list)
* `index.js` has pseudocode to call the contract function to mint against your merkle tree

Installation

* Clone the repo
* Run `yarn` to install packages
* Run `yarn dev` to start a server or `yarn dev -p SOME_PORT_ID` to start a server on a different port
